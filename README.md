### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm now working at Microsoft Research! You'll see me around in various open source codes related to the materials sciences.

Formerly, I was a staff developer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where I helped to lead the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org), an open, academic effort to generate and share high-quality scientific data on materials with the world.

The Materials Project writes and uses a lot of open-source software. If you would like to get involved and contribute to any Materials Project codes, get in touch with the team or you can open a Pull Request!

I also helped create [matsci.org](https://matsci.org), a shared space for the computational materials science community. Please get in touch if you'd like to have a category added for your own code, and come join the discussion :)
