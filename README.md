### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a staff developer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I help to lead the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org), an open, academic effort to generate and share high-quality scientific data on materials with the world.

The Materials Project writes and uses a lot of open-source software. If you would like to get involved and contribute to any of our codes, get in touch! My inbox is open at mkhorton@lbl.gov, or you can open a Pull Request on one of our repositories.
